# CORTEX-SENSE-A-Neuroadaptive-Learning-Assistant
A neuroadaptive EdTech prototype that adapts learning content to your cognitive state in real-time. The application demonstrates a core neuroadaptive feedback loop. It harnesses a simulated stream of real-time brainwave (EEG) data to classify a learner's cognitive state (e.g., "Focused" or "Drowsy").
